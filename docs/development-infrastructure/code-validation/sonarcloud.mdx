## Request access
Sign into [sonarcloud.io](https://sonarcloud.io) and register your Github project.

## Build configuration
There are different ways to enable Sonar in your project, follow the [Getting Started guide](https://about.sonarcloud.io/get-started/) to know more.

You can configure a SonarCloud badge by adding the following syntax at the top of your README.md:

```
[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=<group-id>%3A<artifact-id>&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=&lt;group-id&gt;%3A&lt;artifact-id>)
```

From the [`Account > Security`](https://sonarcloud.io/account/security/) menu of SonarCloud dashboard, you'll be able to generate the token that needs to be passed as `SONAR_TOKEN` environment variable.
