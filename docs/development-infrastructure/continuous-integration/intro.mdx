## Release and deployment

### Continuous (artifact) deployment in Java
When using Java, Travis CI can be easily configured to publish new snapshot artifacts on commit; to enable this feature, a project committer can follow these simple steps:

1. Follow the Java Snapshot deployment configuration ; as a result, you should have username/password credentials (mentioned below as `CI_DEPLOY_USERNAME` and `CI_DEPLOY_PASSWORD`) to access issues.sonatype.org
2. Email [help@finos.org](mailto:help@finos.org) to request permission to deploy artifacts on Maven remote repositories; this action is not required if the developer has already been granted access previously
3. Commit a `settings.xml` file in the project root folder
4. Define `CI_DEPLOY_USERNAME` and `CI_DEPLOY_PASSWORD` variables with Travis CI; make sure that they're encrypted and hidden during the build process; the credentials to use are the ones defined on step 1; if you don't want to share your username/password credentials, you can request and use Nexus tokens
5. Change the `mvn` build command to
  a. Invoke the `deploy` goal
  b. Append `--settings settings.xml` at the end of the build command

[This tutorial](https://coderwall.com/p/9b_lfq/deploying-maven-artifacts-from-travis) walks through the mentioned steps, with more details and configuration options; a working example of this configuration is the [symphony-java-sample-bots project](https://github.com/symphonyoss/symphony-java-sample-bots/blob/dev/.travis.yml).

#### settings.xml sample
```
<settings xmlns="https://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0" xmlns:xsi="https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="https://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>ossrh</id>
      <username>${env.CI_DEPLOY_USERNAME}</username>
      <password>${env.CI_DEPLOY_PASSWORD}</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

### Continuous release in Python
Travis CI can be configured to use [python-semantic-release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a package that simplifies and automates versioning for python projects; a project lead can email [help@finos.org](mailto:help@finos.org) to request Foundation staff to apply the proper Travis CI project settings; packages will be published on behalf of the FINOS pypi user.

### Continuous release in NodeJS
Travis CI can easily publish packages to npm using [semantic-release.org](https://semantic-release.org/), which delegates release operations to your CI environment and allows you to control versioning [using commits (commitizen)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen); as a result, npm packages will be continuously released on each code repository change.

[Follow our instructions](javascript) on how to register a package and user in the Foundation npm organisation.

## GitHub Actions
GitHub gives the ability to create, reuse and share actions, which can be easily described as workloads that can be triggered on a wide range of events.

Actions can be only defined at repository level, creating a `YAML` file in the `.github/workflows` folder. The `Actions` tab available in `github.com` web UI will list the actions defined and show the execution logs.

The Open Developer Platform uses GitHub Actions for the following use cases:
- <a href={useBaseUrl('docs/development-infrastructure/project-documentation')}>Building and publishing Project websites</a>
- <a href={useBaseUrl('docs/project-collaboration')}>Tracking meeting attendance</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/finos/open-developer-platform/blob/master/.github/workflows/project-blueprint.yml">Validating repository compliance (work in progress)</a>

To learn how to use GitHub Actions, start reading [https://help.github.com/en/actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions).
When it's time to start writing your first `.yml` file, we found extremely helpful the following resources:
- [Using the GITHUB_TOKEN in a workflow](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow)
- [Context and expression syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions)
- [Event Types & Payloads](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/)

## Travis CI
Travis CI is a hosted, distributed continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub.

To enable Travis CI on a Foundation hosted project:

1. [Sign in to Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) with your Github credentials
2. Access the [Travis CI profile](https://travis-ci.org/profile/symphonyoss) and sync your project
3. Add a `.travis.yml` file in the root folder of your GitHub repo (check this [.travis.yml](https://github.com/finos/finos-parent-pom/blob/master/.travis.yml) as example)
  a. (optional) If you need to perform variable encryption and other useful commands, install the [Travis CI Client](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb) (using `gem install travis`)
4. Access `https://travis-ci.org/finos/<repository-name>` and validate the build

Please check the [Travis supported languages](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/) and how to [customize your build](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build) to understand if your language is supported and how to configure additional build features.

A badge can be added at the top of the project's root-level `README.md` file, using the following Markdown syntax:

```
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/finos/<repository name>.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/finos/<repository name>)
```

### Example of Configuring Integration Testing
In order to run this sample (some Symphony sample bots), the Travis build needs to be configured to add the following items:

```
# Download certificate before the build script runs
before_script: "curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/symphonyoss/contrib-toolbox/master/scripts/download-files.sh | bash"
```

```
# Define environment variables with Symphony Pod endpoints
env:
 global:
  - FOUNDATION_API_URL=https://foundation-dev-api.symphony.com
  - FOUNDATION_POD_URL=https://foundation-dev.symphony.com
  - SESSIONAUTH_URL=$FOUNDATION_API_URL/sessionauth
  - KEYAUTH_URL=$FOUNDATION_API_URL/keyauth
  - POD_URL=$FOUNDATION_POD_URL/pod
  - AGENT_URL=$FOUNDATION_POD_URL/agent
```

At this point, the certificates are in place and downloaded into the build box; integration tests can resolve User Identity certificates by accessing environment variables.

The [symphony-java-sample-bots](https://github.com/symphonyoss/symphony-java-sample-bots/) was amongst the first Foundation projects that was enabled to run integration tests from Travis CI; the [Travis build logs](https://travis-ci.org/symphonyoss/symphony-java-sample-bots/) for this project show the info below.

- The (hidden) environment variables that identify User Identity certificates (in this case 2, one for the message sender, one for the message receiver)

```
# Setting environment variables from repository settings
$ export DOWNLOAD_PATH=[secure]
$ export DOWNLOAD_ITEMS=[secure]
$ export TRUSTSTORE_FILE=[secure]
$ export TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD=[secure]
$ export BOT_USER_EMAIL=[secure]
$ export BOT_USER_CERT_FILE=[secure]
$ export SENDER_USER_EMAIL=[secure]
$ export SENDER_USER_CERT_FILE=[secure]
$ export DOWNLOAD_HOST=[secure]
$ export SENDER_USER_CERT_PASSWORD=[secure]
$ export BOT_USER_CERT_PASSWORD=[secure]
```

#### Known Certificate Issues
```
Caused by: javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Given final block not properly padded at
org.symphonyoss.simplebot.EchoBotIT.sendAndReceiveEcho(EchoBotIT.java:64)
```
This basically means that the certificate password is wrong; to validate the certificate using the following command:
```
openssl pkcs12 -info -nodes \
-in <certificate_path> \
-passin pass:<certificate_password>
```

Reminder for Foundation staff: every password symbol must be escaped by prefixing it with character ‘\’, before setting it as Travis environment variable.

#### Branch specific build commands
Travis CI does not provide a syntax to specify branch-specific build commands; however, it is possible to use the following `.travis.yml` syntax to workaround it; in this example, the Maven build will use the `sonar` profile only if the current branch is master.
```
script:
- "[[ $TRAVIS_BRANCH =~ master ]] && mvn clean deploy -Pintegration-testing,sonar --settings settings.xml"
- "[[ $TRAVIS_BRANCH =~ dev ]] && mvn clean deploy -Pintegration-testing --settings settings.xml"
```

## Azure Pipelines

FINOS can provide projects with Azure Pipelines integration on [https://dev.azure.com/finosfoundation](https://dev.azure.com/finosfoundation).

You can follow docs on the [Microsoft docs page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/create-first-pipeline)

## MyGet
[Myget](https://myget.org/) is a friction-free continuous integration & delivery for your nuget, npm, bower and vsix packages; the Foundation provides package repositories, which allow:

1. **Pre-release build and publishing**, using build environments that are equipped with .NET Framework and Visual Studio (headless); it also features source code tagging and version updates on source code based on incremental build number, to fully automate the package publishing pipeline
2. **Sync with NuGet**, that can be either manual (promoting pre-releases to releases using MyGet web interface) or automatic (a committer must create a personal account on MyGet and request access from the Foundation in order to be able to push packages)

In order to request a project to be integrated with MyGet, a Project lead can sign up to MyGet and email [help@finos.org](mailto:help@finos.org) the following info:
1. Project coordinates - GitHub project url and other useful info
2. MyGet username
3. CSProj and CS files - Where project descriptors are located
4. Packages - A list of the packages that need to be published; by default all packages are taken into account
5. Publishing strategy to NuGet - Whether to enable automatic publishing based on source code branching or rely on manual package pushing using the MyGet interface; if the latter, a MyGet personal account username must be provided

An example of project building with MyGet is the Symphony [RestApiClient project](https://symphonyoss.atlassian.net/wiki/github.com/symphonyoss/RestApiClient), which is also published on the [FINOS MyGet repository](https://www.myget.org/feed/ssf-restapiclient/package/nuget/SymphonyOSS.RestApiClient) and [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SymphonyOSS.RestApiClient/).

Badges can be added at the top of the project's root-level `README.md` file, using the following Markdown syntax:

- Build status: 
```
[![MyGet Build Status](https://www.myget.org/BuildSource/Badge/<feed name>?identifier=<guid>)](https://www.myget.org/feed/<feed name>/package/nuget/<package name>)
```
- Latest Pre-Release package published: 
```
