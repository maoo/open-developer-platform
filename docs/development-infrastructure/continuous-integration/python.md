[**Python**](https://www.python.org/) is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.  Packages are published on the [Python Package Index (pypi)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi), however the FINOS account is still empty, see [pypi.org/user/finos](https://pypi.org/user/finos/) .

## Publishing on Pypi
Python packages can be easily installed using [pip or easy_install](https://packaging.python.org/pip_easy_install/); in order to publish a Python package to the Python Package Index, follow the [simple steps described on this blogpost](https://peterdowns.com/posts/first-time-with-pypi.html).

That said, the Foundation is still working on a centralised, automated way to publish (and sign) Python packages so that they can be managed by Foundation Staff.
