The ODP Project team is tasked with advising and prioritizing the building and managing of FINOS infrastructure that FINOS members are able to access for communication and open source software development.


The team collaboratively maintains a [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/orgs/finos/projects/8) of requirements, and the FINOS Infra team - with the help of FINOS Community - independently works through that backlog in priority order.

The ODP Project was approved by the FinServ Developer Experience PMC (now disbanded) on 21 June 2018.

## Team members
The team is composed by FINOS staff, bank institutions and software vendors, who help prioritizing, validating, testing and evangelizing the ODP features across FINOS community.
- [Brian Ingenito](https://github.com/bingenito) (Morgan Stanley) - Project Lead
- [Maurizio Pillitu](https://github.com/maoo) (DevOps Director, FINOS)
- [James McLeod](https://github.com/mcleo-d) (Community Director, FINOS)
