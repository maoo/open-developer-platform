The [Coverity Scan](https://scan.coverity.com/) service was initiated with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as the largest public-private sector research project in the world, focused on open source software quality and security; it is now a free service to the open source community.

Below are listed the main CoverityScan features that have been adopted by Foundation projects.

1. Integration with CI environments
2. Scans code for security vulnerabilities
3. Scans code for bad practices
4. Scans code for bugs

Please note that Coverity applies [frequency build limits](https://scan.coverity.com/faq#frequency); the build configuration (and/or branching strategy) must be adapted to avoid high submission rate.
